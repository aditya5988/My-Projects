Born in Los Angeles, DiCaprio began his career in the late 1980s by appearing in television commercials. In the early 1990s, he had recurring roles in various television shows, such as the sitcom Parenthood, and had his first major film part as author Tobias Wolff in This Boy's Life (1993). At age 19, he received critical acclaim and his first Academy Award and Golden Globe Award nominations for his performance as a developmentally disabled boy in What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993). He achieved international stardom with the star-crossed romances Romeo + Juliet (1996) and Titanic (1997). After the latter became the highest-grossing film at the time, he reduced his workload for a few years. In an attempt to shed his image of a romantic hero, DiCaprio sought roles in other genres, including crime drama in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002); the latter marked the first of his many successful collaborations with director Martin Scorsese.
DiCaprio portrayed Howard Hughes in The Aviator (2004) and received acclaim for his performances in the political thriller Blood Diamond (2006), the crime drama The Departed (2006), and the romantic drama Revolutionary Road (2008). In the following decade, DiCaprio starred in several high-profile directors' projects, including the science fiction thriller Inception (2010), the western Django Unchained (2012), the biopic The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), the survival drama The Revenant (2015), for which he won an Academy Award and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the comedy-drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), all of which were critical and commercial successes.

DiCaprio is the founder of Appian Way Productions, a production company that has produced some of his films and the documentary series Greensburg (2008–2010), and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. He regularly supports charitable causes and has produced several documentaries on the environment. In 2005, he was named a Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for his contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he appeared in Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world.

Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born on November 11, 1974, in Los Angeles, California.[1] He is the only child of Irmelin (née Indenbirken), a legal secretary, and George DiCaprio, an underground comix writer, publisher, and distributor of comic books; they met while attending college and moved to Los Angeles after graduating.[2][3][4] His father is of Italian and German descent; DiCaprio is conversant in Italian[5][6] and German.[7] His maternal grandfather, Wilhelm Indenbirken, was German,[8] and his maternal grandmother, Helene Indenbirken, was a Russian-born German citizen.[9][10] In an interview in Russia, DiCaprio referred to himself as "half-Russian" and said that two of his late grandparents were Russian.[9] DiCaprio was raised Catholic.[11]

DiCaprio was named Leonardo because his mother, then pregnant with him, first felt him kick while she was looking at a Leonardo da Vinci painting in the Uffizi museum in Florence, Italy.[12][a] His parents separated when he was one year old; they initially agreed to live next door to each other to not deprive DiCaprio of his father's presence in his life as he mostly lived with his mother.[14][15] For a while though, DiCaprio lived with his father, stepmother and older stepbrother, Adam Farrar, with whom he was close growing up.[16] DiCaprio and his mother later moved around to multiple Los Angeles neighborhoods, such as Echo Park and Los Feliz, while she worked several jobs.[2] He went to the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies for four years and later Seeds Elementary School, before moving onto the John Marshall High School.[17][18] DiCaprio has said he hated public school and often asked his mother to take him to auditions instead to improve their financial situation.[19] He dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma.[20]

DiCaprio has said his career choice as a child was to become a marine biologist or an actor but eventually favored the latter, as he was fond of impersonating characters and imitating people.[21] When he was two, he went on stage at a performance festival and danced spontaneously; the cheerful response from the crowd started his interest in performing.[22] His stepbrother earned $50,000 for a television commercial, which fascinated DiCaprio and helped him decide to become an actor.[23] In 1979, DiCaprio, at age five, was removed from the set of the children's television series Romper Room for being disruptive.[24][25] He began appearing in several commercials at age 14 for Matchbox cars by Mattel, which he considered his first role,[24][26] and later for Kraft Foods, Bubble Yum, and Apple Jacks.[27] In 1989, he played the role of Glen in two episodes of the television show The New Lassie.[28][29]
